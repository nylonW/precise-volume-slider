## Privacy & Permissions

### Limited Permissions Approach
This extension uses content scripts that only run on YouTube video pages. We do not request any host permissions, which means:

- The extension can only access and modify the YouTube video pages you visit
- It cannot access your browsing history or data on other websites
- It does not collect or transmit any personal data
- It works entirely within the page you're viewing

We believe in minimizing permissions to only what's necessary for functionality, ensuring your privacy while providing a useful tool.
